# Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/archcloud-aiseo.git

# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push all feature branches
git push origin feature/aiseo-auth-layout
git push origin feature/aiseo-projects-dashboard
git push origin feature/aiseo-keywords-content-briefs
git push origin feature/aiseo-seo-audits
git push origin feature/aiseo-integrations

```

## OR Push Everything at Once

```bash
git push -u origin --all
```

## Daily Workflow Example
